This is a Python package that supports only on windows,
We are working hard to make them available in Mac and Linux, too,

The Main aim of this package is to help users create bulk "E-CERTIFICATES" and distribute them through mails,
We have had this module under testing for 3000+ mails and we have had it stable, 

People using this must be aware of using a G-Suite account as they have (gmail limits set to maximum amounts,)

!!! Please donot use this module for spamming, they are purely meant to distribute E-Certificates or Create them,
!!! Make sure you only provide CSV files !!!

Installation : pip install cgm

Usage : for (only generating bulk certificates)

    from cgm import Certificates

    certificate = Certificates()
    if certificate.read_csv('Your csv filename if present in project root directory || full path to your csv file'):
        a.renderCertificate('Your csv filename if present in project root directory || full path to your csv file')

    this will promt you a small command line interface to move your text to the top / bottom / left / right
    and also choose your text size, (to continue with defaults press enter!!)

    and if you are satisfied with your cetificates then you can press 1 when prompted, then all your certificates will be ready in a folder 
    name Certificates and then if you wish to proceed, you can pass in the send_mail method of the Mailer() class

sending Mails:
    on sending Mails:
        you will be prompted to attach images / certificates,
        Please press (1) if you want to..

        and make sure you fill out all the fields of the Mailer object

        example:
            
            from cgm import Mailer

            mail = Mailer()
            mail.username = '' #your username
            mail.password = '' #your password

            ((( This process might seem of a security issue but , it isn't, the program hosts a local server in your machine and then distributes the mails and quits out from it automatically, so you don't need to worry about the security)))

            And make sure you don't add them to your github pages with the username and password

    Changing Font Styles : 
        we use the default font as Arial Black,
        if you wish to change the font format, please specify the font-path in the object of the Mailer / Certificate 's objects

        example:
            obj.font_path = '' # the complete path to the font


    Errors:
        one main Error would be the encoding formats,
            we use default encoding format as 'utf-8' in case of promted to use another encoder, please pass them as an argument to the Mailer / Certificate 's read_csv() method
            
            obj.read_csv('filename', encoding_f = 'thedesired format')
                for defaults:
                    obj.read_csv('filename') will do.
        
        We have made our best to handle errors, and working on them to make them more user friendly,
